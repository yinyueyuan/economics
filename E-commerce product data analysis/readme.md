# JD.com Product Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the price distribution of products on JD.com platform, with a focus on determining whether self-operated stores generally have higher prices than non-self-operated stores. By scraping 100 pages of product data, we conduct in-depth analysis from multiple dimensions including store distribution, price ranges, and sales volume.

## Key Findings

### Dominance of Self-Operated Stores
Self-operated stores capture over 80% of total sales volume with less than 10% of product listings, demonstrating strong consumer preference for JD's self-operated stores.

### Price Concentration Trend
More than 86% of products are priced below 400 RMB, indicating consumers' strong preference for mid-to-low price range products.

### Highly Competitive Market Landscape
30% of specialized stores have to compete for less than 3% of total sales volume, reflecting intense market competition.

## Analysis Dimensions

### Store Type Classification
Stores are categorized into four types: JD Self-operated, Flagship Stores, Specialized Stores, and Others for comparative analysis.

### Price Segment Analysis
Products are divided into 9 price ranges (0-100, 100-200, ..., Above 1K RMB) to analyze distribution across different price points.

### Sales Volume Estimation
Cumulative sales volume is estimated based on product review counts, reflecting market performance.

## Technical Implementation
Data processing and analysis are performed using Python, primarily relying on libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset comprises 5,907 valid product entries collected from JD.com platform.

## Project Value
Provides data-driven insights for e-commerce operations, helping merchants understand market competition patterns and consumer price preferences, thereby supporting pricing strategies and store positioning decisions.
